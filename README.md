# C-Banking-System
 Banking System in C++


<h1>Description </h1>
<p>
This repository contains a console-based Banking System implemented in C++, demonstrating core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and file handling. The system is designed to simulate basic banking functionalities, providing an intuitive interface to manage customer accounts. </p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>
Account Creation: Open new accounts with a unique account number, first name, last name, and initial balance.<br>
Balance Inquiry: Retrieve the current balance and account details using the account number.<br>
Deposit Funds: Add money to an existing account.<br>
Withdraw Funds: Withdraw money from an account while ensuring a minimum balance of â‚¹500. <br>
Close Account: Delete an account from the bank's database. <br>
Display All Accounts: View details of all active accounts in the bank.<br>
Persistent Storage: Save and load account details using the Bank.data file, ensuring data remains available across program runs.
</p>
