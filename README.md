# C-Banking-System
 Banking System in C++

Description
This repository contains a console-based Banking System implemented in C++, demonstrating core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and file handling. The system is designed to simulate basic banking functionalities, providing an intuitive interface to manage customer accounts.

Features
Account Creation: Open new accounts with a unique account number, first name, last name, and initial balance.
Balance Inquiry: Retrieve the current balance and account details using the account number.
Deposit Funds: Add money to an existing account.
Withdraw Funds: Withdraw money from an account while ensuring a minimum balance of â‚¹500.
Close Account: Delete an account from the bank's database.
Display All Accounts: View details of all active accounts in the bank.
Persistent Storage: Save and load account details using the Bank.data file, ensuring data remains available across program runs.
Technologies Used
C++: Programming language for the entire application.
File Handling: To store and retrieve account data from the Bank.data file.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Core design principle for the Account and Bank classes.
Usage
This project is ideal for:

Learning OOP concepts in C++.
Understanding how file handling can be used to create persistent systems.
Exploring a practical implementation of a banking system.
